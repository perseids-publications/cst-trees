## How to configure with your own treebanks

```
git clone git@github.com:perseids-publications/treebank-template.git my-trees
cd my-trees
git remote rename origin source
git remote add origin <my-trees origin>
git push -u origin master
```

* Copy all your trees into `public/xml`
* Update the `src/config.json` file
* Update `name` and `homepage` in `package.json`
* Update the information in `.env`

### Updating

* `git pull source master`
* Fix merge conflicts
* `git push origin master`

## Installation

`yarn install`

## Running the development server

`yarn start`

## Building for deployment

Before creating a production build you need to know the path where it will be accessed.
Then run the command `PUBLIC_URL='./path/of/app' yarn build`.
This will generate a set of static files in the `build/` directory that you can serve.

For example, if you want to deploy it at `www.example.com/` then run `PUBLIC_URL='./' yarn build`.
If you want to deploy it at `www.example.com/lexica/lsj` then run
`PUBLIC_URL='./lexica/lsj' yarn build`.

## Deploying a new version to github.io

`yarn deploy`
